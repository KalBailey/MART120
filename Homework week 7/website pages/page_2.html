      <h1>O Me! O Life!</h1>
      <h2>Walt Whitman</h2>
      <p>Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,</p>
      <p>Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,</p>
      <p>Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)</p>
      <p>Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,</p>
      <p>Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,</p>
      <p>Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,</p>
      <p>The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?</p>
      <p>                                       <i>Answer.</i></p>
      <p>That you are here—that life exists and identity,</p>
      <p>That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.</p>
